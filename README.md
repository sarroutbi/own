[![Spellcheck](https://github.com/sarroutbi/own/actions/workflows/spellcheck.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sarroutbi/own/actions/workflows/spellcheck.yaml)

Collection of different stuff that I find interesting. Divided in two sections:
* **scripts**: Those scripts that ease day to day working
* **config**: Configuration stuff that I used in my current development environment (emacs, screen, etc.)
